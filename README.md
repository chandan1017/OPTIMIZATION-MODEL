## üìù Project Overview

As part of my internship at CodTech, I completed Task 4: Optimization Model, which involved solving a real-world business problem using linear programming techniques in Python. The project aimed to optimize furniture production to maximize profit under limited resources. In this scenario, a company produces Chairs and Tables, with each Chair generating a profit of ‚Çπ50 and each Table ‚Çπ60. The available resources included 100 units of wood and 120 labor hours, where a Chair required 2 units of wood and 3 labor hours, and a Table required 3 units of wood and 2 labor hours. The objective was to determine the optimal number of Chairs and Tables to produce to achieve the highest possible profit while adhering to resource constraints.

To solve this, I used Python 3.13 and the PuLP library, which is commonly used for linear and integer programming. The optimization problem was modeled using decision variables, an objective function to maximize profit, and constraints representing the limited availability of wood and labor. The solution was implemented in both a standalone Python script (.py) and a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) to support both scripted execution and interactive analysis. Development and testing were carried out in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

After executing the model, the optimal solution recommended producing 32 Chairs and 12 Tables, resulting in a maximum profit of ‚Çπ2320, while staying within the defined resource limits. The output confirmed an Optimal status, with all constraints satisfied. Screenshots from the terminal and notebook were included to visually document the results.

This task deepened my understanding of operations research, mathematical modeling, and how optimization techniques can be applied in practical business scenarios such as manufacturing, logistics, and resource planning. It also demonstrated the power of Python libraries like PuLP in supporting data-driven decision-making. Both the script and notebook are available in the project repository for reference and reproducibility.
